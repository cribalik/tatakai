### Inspiration ###

## Wet ##
I want to create something that recreates the feeling I got playing the game "Wet". 
Wet is at a first glance a pretty standard third person action shooter, but with the twist that every time you do a stunt like sliding, diving, wall running, etc. you go into slow-motion, or "bullet time", giving you more time to aim and shoot down the enemies around you.
The first playthrough of the game did not really require you to do all these stunts to complete it, making it very easy to pick up, but if the player does not go any further, only gives the impression of being nothing but a sub-par third person shoot-em-up. Successfully chaining the stunts is pretty difficult at first, but whenever you succeed to do these stunts you instantly feel badass, even though it is mostly aesthetic since you don't need the extra bullet time to get through the levels.
But, as you progress through the game and difficulty increases you realize that you need to start chaining these stunts in order to get the edge on your enemies. In order to teach the player these moves, there are target practice levels scattered throughout the game, that require that you do good stunt chaining in order to get good times on the target practices. Again, rewarding players who want to put down the time in getting good.
Later on the hardest mode you basically have do complete whole levels without leaving stunt chains once, or you instantly die. While this is a bit extreme, you really feel badass with bullets flying everywhere in slowmo, while still being difficult.

So these are the basic points that I want to replicate and iterate on
 * Reward players putting effort into being good by making it more cinematic (making you feel more badass) the better you are
 * Easy to pick up, you don't need to do these stunts in order to complete the game
 * But still give strong indications that you SHOULD be doing these things, if you want to be badass. Extra points, prompts whatever. Wet also did this with target practice leves, but I would like to think of a better way to do it.
 * On higher difficulties, have a difficulty that basically mandates you do these stunts.

## Metroidvania
I want to combine this with my love for the metroidvania genre as well as the dark souls series, in particular the concepts of
 * The player increases in strength as you progress through the game (BUT, in comparison to many RPG-esque games, this should only have a small impact. The MAIN power-up you can get in the game should be your own skill as a player, in very dark-souls spirit)
 * Progress path through the game is partially dictated by difficulty, not locked areas (again a-la dark souls)
 * Tight, challenging platform combat. (Castlevania style)
 * Local coop (couch gaming is something i really miss from games nowadays)

## other additions ##

 * Instead of mana and stuff to limit attack spamming, try having a short cooldown whenever you miss, so that chaining "attack - switch attack - slide - attack - wall jump - attack" without missing, will be more effective than just spamming the attack button
 * Portals a la Portal, but with more catlevania-eque asthetics


## Questions ##
 * How will levels work? Hand-crafted? Procedural? Sandbox?
